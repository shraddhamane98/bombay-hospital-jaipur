                                        <div class="text">Shri Madhav Prasad Birla, Vice-Chairman of the Bombay Hospital Trust was born in Bombay on the 4th July, 1918. Shri M. P. Babu, as he was universally and affectionately known, was a man of great enterprise, who set up a host of companies like Birla Corp, Universal Cables, Vindhya Telelinks, Hindustan Gum & Chemicals, Digvijay Woollen Mills, Indian Smelting, etc., all leaders in their own fields, manufacturing quality products. He also established Birla Planetorium & Belle Vue Clinic and several schools in Calcutta.</div>

                                <li>Shri M. P. Babu will be remembered as a great philanthropist rather than as a leading and eminent industrialist. Totally devoid of ego, and instinctively averse to self-advertisement, he gave profusely and generously to charitable causes spread over the length and breadth of the country, without ever expecting or allowing his name to be associated with his munificent donations.</li>

                                <li>He established the M. P. Birla Foundation in fulfilment of his deep commitment to furthering progress in the fields of education and medicine. Shri M. P. Birla was also intimately associated with the famous Birla Institute of Technology & Science at Pilani.</li>

                                <li>Bombay Hospital enjoyed a very special place in his heart. He liberally gave crores of rupees to this great Institution. He took keen interest in the working of the Hospital and made frequent enquiries about the quality of treatment, more particularly to the poor and needy. He was responsible in no small measure, for the growth and development of the Hospital, set up by his illustrious father Shri Rameshwardasji Birla, into a 750 bedded Hospital, one of the largest and best equipped in the country.</li>

                                <li>In private life he was shy and self-effacing and a man of simple habits with few needs, a man who earned in order to spend it for worthy causes. Indeed, he imbibed the great message of the Upanishads that wealth should be enjoyed by giving it generously.</li>

                                <li>Shri M. P. Babu breathed his last on 30th July, 1990 at Calcutta. With his demise the nation has lost an eminent industrialist a great philanthropist, and above all, a good human being.</li>

                                        <div class="text">Born on 3rd November, 1908, in the well-known public spirited Zamindar family of Najidabad in U.P., known as the Sahu Jain family, Babuji, as he was affectionately addressed, had in his youth, the advantage of seeing in operation, and coming in contact with, the cultural ethos of the period, where Hindus, Muslims, Jains and other communities, had evolved a pattern of living in amity, and peacefully following the practices of their respective religions and social codes.</div>
                                    </div>

                                <li>It was this blend of cultural actions and reactions, that had gone into the mental make-up of Babuji, resulting in the formation of an integrated Indian personality, steadfast in the inherited cultural values and adept at adjustment with best that was progressive and modern.</li>

                                <li>Babuji’s passion for social, civic and educational activities, became manifest at an early stage of his life, during which he founded numerous schools, colleges, dispensaries and charitable institutions, to foster education, and provide medical relief to the poor and the needy.</li>

                                <li>He was a multi-facetted personality, covering diverse fields like education, industry, social welfare and religion. He was a Member of the First Rajya Sabha from Bombay, for six years 1952 – 1958, and was one of the most widely respected industrialist in the country, whose advice and guidance was regularly sought on all matters concerning industry and finance.</li>

                                <li>He was the leader of the Jain Community and in recognition of his services to the community, he was honoured with the titles of ”SHRIYANS ABHINAV” and ”SAMAJ SHIROMANI” and was also awarded the ”TAMRA PATRA” for his devotion and continued service, not only to Jains but to the public at large. He was conferred title of ”SHRAVAK SHIROMANI”, the highest title the community can offer to its leaders, in recognition of his services to the Jain community. In 1988, Babuji was decorated with the prestigious award of Padma Bhushan, for his manifold services to society.</li>

                                <li>He was a Trustee of the Bombay Hospital Trust, ever since its inception, and on the demise of the founder Chairman, Shri Rameshwardasji Birla in 1973, the mantle of Chairmanship of the Bombay Hospital Trust, fell on his capable shoulders. He built on the edifice raised by Shri Rameshwardasji Birla, and was in no small measures, responsible for the Hospital becoming one of the premier medical institution in the country. In his association with the affairs of the Hospital, he brought to bear his usual thoroughness and passion for detail. There was no aspect of the running of the Hospital that he was not conversant with, and amazed everyone as to how, inspite of his multifarious and diverse activities, compounded by his delicate health, he still found the time and the energy, to go deep into matters concerning the Hospital. He was always willing to lend a patient ear to doctors, officials and others connected with the Hospital, who came to him for advice and guidance, and endeared himself to everyone who came in contact with him, with his humility, gentleness and innate goodness. The demise of Shri Shriyansprasadji is indeed an irreparable loss, not only to his family but also to his friends, admirers and the business community. The country has lost a great and good man. The Bombay Hospital Trust will miss his wise counsel and guidance.</li>
